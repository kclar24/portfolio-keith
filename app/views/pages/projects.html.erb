      About this website:
      <br />
      This portfolio site is a Ruby on Rails app written as a single-page website using jQuery. It's goal is to fulfil the dual purpose of displaying both my work and my skills with javascript, jquery, and single-page functionality.  Also, hopefully you've noticed the sleek, minimalistic design (and how about that trendy lower-case asthetic?).

      This website is demonstration of my capabilities with Content Management Systems.  For this particular website, I used Wix to create an easily manageable sculpture portfolio for the client from scratch.  I used quotes from Bennett's own writing to accent areas of the site that I felt needed to be accentuated.  The rustic, mechanical theme fit Bennett's artist aesthetic well.  Overall, the website turned out beautiful, despite what I feel to be constricting tools provided by Wix.

      Breakonomics is a Ruby on Rails app including extensive back-end capability to monitor purchases and users.  It includes an eShop with PayPal capability (the owner specifically requested PayPal only).  Devise was used to create account registry and login.  I re-branded the business as Breakonomics, and created the logo.

      This project is for a graphic designer who also is an expert screen printer.  When completed, it will showcase my abilities with parallax scrolling - which I find to be a beautiful effect for websites.  It will be built using Ruby on Rails.  Justin has entertained screen printing or aqueous themes - I am excited for the possibilities this opens up for the page.  Check back soon for the completed project!
