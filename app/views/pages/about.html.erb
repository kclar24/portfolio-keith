    long version:  i'm a 90's kid who grew up, hit the brick wall that is "real life", and very nearly flatlined before discovering something i actaully enjoyed doing enough to call a career.  luckily, along the way i picked on up some skills in other areas i enjoy, such as marketing and sales.  i earned my mba and gained some great life experience as a claims adjuster and then as an event specialist at one of the top entertainment companies in los angeles.

    in los angeles, i discovered my passion for web devlopment accidentally - i had more fun building my blog than i ever did writing content for it.  so, i dug deeper, and here i am - a graduate of the tech talent south bootcamp program here in new orleans, la, and a freelance developer.

    i'm not giving up on that blog thing, completely (that's what i keep telling myself).
